# clk_bat_installer
A simple .bat script to help you installing clk.

The [clk](https://github.com/clk-project/clk) tool is made for bash terminals, and so the official installation script is writent for bash.
However in order to be able to use clk ans its extensions through a "Windows" terminal, clk can be setup using the [install_clk.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sskorupski/clk_bat_installer/master/install_clk.bat) script.
